= Historical Linguistics


Historical Linguistics is arguably a really old part of linguistics. The neogrammarians found cognates between latin, greek and sankrit, but more importantly they found cognancy between sound laws. This is the most important part, in which they have a system that consistently maps between. That is, the sound is regualr.


A famous example is Grimm's law. This is known as a chain shift in which certain consontats correspond in other consonants.

For exampls latin cognates picic fish, whatever german and lots

Another sound law that's really common is called paltalization.

For instance spanish _caesar_


- Sound Change is regular
- Well, probably not that regular
- Context based sound law changes


Somehting somthing let's get started with sound laws.

== Sound Laws

Linguists have a conventialized representation for laws.

Usually they write them in teh form $A > B$ where $A$ is a phoneme that gets changed, and $B$ is the phoneme that it gets changed into. They can be changed to represent the sound laws $A > B > C$ such as the Grimm's law, which can be represeneted as #xsampa("d > t >")  Ï‘

To represent context laws they usually

$ A > B \/ X #underline(extent: 5pt, [ --- ]) Y $

$A  B \/\; C\_ \; D$
 so that ~ is ~


it #sym.tilde.basic
