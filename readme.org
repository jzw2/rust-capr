#+title: A Capr like system written in rust


Capr like system but with improvements

* Progress
Current goal is to get a functional system that is able to do the bare minimum of Capr.

 - Specficaiton of sound laws
 - Apply laws of proto form to get modern reflex
 - Apply laws backwards to get potential proto form.

* (Potential) Goals
** More user friendly sound law inputs
Ideally, the user should be able to input sound laws without having to learn the fst formalism.
** Modelling wave like approaches
Using FSTs are quite general and is not restricted to the tree model. The wave model can also be used as long as the sound laws are at least somewhat regular.
** Non determinism in sound laws
As long as there is some regularity, the FST should also be able to generate all output froms if a sound law can be specified. This will ideally be able to output doublets in romance.
* Current Limitations
- Parallel substitutions is not supported
- Only upper, upper substitution is supported
